Using Bootstrap in React

There are 3 Ways

1) Using cdn
    We have to import the cdn in public/index.html
2)Install Bootstrap npm package
    After installing Bootstrap we need to import main css in index.js
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
3)Use bootstrap designed for react packages like react-bootstrap
